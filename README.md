# P2P Tutoring Marketplace

## Vision

The P2P Tutoring Marketplace aims to revolutionize the educational landscape by creating a decentralized platform where students can directly connect with tutors. By leveraging the transparency and security of blockchain technology, the platform ensures that transactions are secure, payments are fair, and the quality of tutoring services is maintained through a robust rating system.

## Flowchart

**Flowchart Overview:**

1. **Tutor Registration**: Tutors register on the platform, providing their details, expertise, and rate per hour.
2. **Session Request**: Students browse registered tutors and request sessions by specifying the duration.
3. **Payment**: Students pay upfront for the session, with the payment held in escrow.
4. **Session Completion**: Tutors complete the session, triggering the release of payment.
5. **Rating & Feedback**: Both tutors and students provide ratings and feedback after the session.
